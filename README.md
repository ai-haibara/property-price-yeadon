# property-price-yeadon
This is a small project to predict the property prices in Yeadon, an area of Leeds.

I used a combination of data collected from HM land registry and scrapping data from epc to get the information I needed: surface of properties. 

I had to fill one blank using Rightmove.

I then conducted a simple Linear Regression analysis to predict the property prices in Yeadon.
